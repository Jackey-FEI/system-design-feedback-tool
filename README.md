# Version 1.0.0
This is a tool to help us to review the design of a system.
- It can use RAG to get example answers from the internet
- It provides prompts for LLM to better review the design

At this phase, it can be used as a MCP server which is tested on Claude Desktop App as MCP client.

## How to use
### User it directly in terminal
1. Get the required packages
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the server directly in terminal
```bash
python3 server.py
```
3. Open the MCP client and connect to the server
4. Start the review process
